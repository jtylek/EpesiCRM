# Bug patterns worth recognizing if they recur

These are already-fixed bugs, kept here not for their fix (see git history/
commit messages for that) but because their *root-cause shape* is generic
enough to plausibly recur elsewhere in this codebase.

## Raw DB record vs. form submission — same variable, different shape

`RecordBrowser`'s processing-callback convention passes the *same* `$values`
parameter in multiple modes, but its shape differs by mode: `'display'`/
`'view'` modes receive the **raw stored DB record** (real column names only);
`'add'`/`'edit'`/`'adding'`/`'editing'` modes receive a **form submission**
(`$_POST`-shaped, includes virtual/checkbox-only fields with no backing
column). A callback that checks `$values['some_checkbox']` (a form-only key)
while running in display/view mode will find it simply never set —
`isset(...)` is always false there, silently flipping whatever conditional
logic depended on it.

Found in `CRM_MeetingCommon::submit_meeting()`'s `'display'` case: it checked
`$values['timeless']` (the edit-form's checkbox name) to decide whether to
render a time/duration row, but a raw meeting record has no `timeless`
column — the real persisted signal is `duration == -1`, which every *other*
timeless check in that same file already used correctly. Fixed by matching
the existing pattern.

**How to apply**: when a `RecordBrowser`/`GenericBrowser` processing callback
checks a form-checkbox-shaped key directly, check what mode it's meant to run
in — if it can run against a raw record, look for the real persisted column
that key is actually derived from instead.

## `strtotime()` always reads slash dates as m/d/y, regardless of app locale

`Base_RegionalSettingsCommon::reg2time()` fed the regional-formatted date
string straight into PHP's `strtotime()`. For any user configured to
`%d/%m/%Y`, this is wrong: `strtotime()` interprets a slash-separated numeric
date as **month/day/year** no matter what `setlocale()` or app-level format
settings say (a documented PHP quirk, not something app config affects). Day
≤ 12 silently transposed day/month; day > 12 failed outright and callers'
`date('Y-m-d', false)`-style conversions coerced the `false` result to epoch
`1970-01-01`.

This is the single shared parser behind essentially every date-type field in
the app (birth date, meeting/fax dates, any RecordBrowser 'date'/'timestamp'
field) — a regression here is not scoped to one screen. Fixed by detecting a
`%d/%m/%Y`-shaped format and swapping the day/month capture groups before
handing off to `strtotime()`.

**How to apply**: any future date-format addition to
`$date_formats_proto` that puts day before month in a slash-separated pattern
needs the same swap-before-`strtotime()` treatment, or it will reproduce this
exact bug for that new format.

## "Restore Defaults" bypassing the admin-configured-default override chain

`Base_User_Settings`'s form builder used
`Base_User_SettingsCommon::get_admin($module, $name)` (which correctly falls
back through admin-configured → hardcoded literal) for a setting's
*displayed* value, but the *reset* value baked into the "Restore Defaults"
button's JS still came from each field's hardcoded literal directly — so a
regular user's Restore Defaults silently ignored whatever an administrator
had configured via **My settings/Administration → Default user settings**.

**How to apply**: any UI that offers "reset to default" needs to resolve
"default" through the same admin-override chain the rest of the settings
system uses (`get_admin()`), not re-derive it from the field's own
declaration — the two can silently diverge exactly like this.

## A settings/data report that looks like a browser bug usually isn't

An ActionBar showing far more icons than expected, reported as "looks fine in
Firefox, Chrome shows everything," turned out to be **Quick Access settings
data** (`Base_Menu_QuickAccessCommon::user_settings()`, 100% DB-backed per
`user_login_id`, nothing in that render path is browser-conditional) — not a
CSS/rendering difference. Two per-module toggles exist there: "Dashboard"
(confusingly named — actually means "show inline in the ActionBar") and
"Launchpad" (show in the Launchpad popup), both defaulting to on.

**How to apply**: before touching ActionBar/Leightbox/Launchpad CSS or JS for
a "shows too many/wrong icons" report, check that account's
**My settings → Control panel → Quick Access** first — a "different browser
looks different" report for this specific screen is almost always two
different accounts, or the same account's settings changed between
observations (e.g. an accidental Restore Defaults click), not a rendering bug.

## Known, still-open issue: Shoutbox delete UI doesn't work

The History tab's delete icon (`Apps_Shoutbox::delete_msg()`/
`can_delete_msg()`) does not actually delete a message on this install — not
yet root-caused (could be `can_delete_msg()`'s permission logic, or something
broken in GenericBrowser row-action rendering here). Workaround: soft-delete
directly —

```sql
UPDATE apps_shoutbox_messages SET deleted=1 WHERE id=<id>;
```

Never hard-delete; the module's own design keeps all messages in history.

# Bug patterns worth recognizing if they recur

These are already-fixed bugs, kept here not for their fix (see git history/
commit messages for that) but because their *root-cause shape* is generic
enough to plausibly recur elsewhere in this codebase.

## Raw DB record vs. form submission — same variable, different shape

`RecordBrowser`'s processing-callback convention passes the *same* `$values`
parameter in multiple modes, but its shape differs by mode: `'display'`/
`'view'` modes receive the **raw stored DB record** (real column names only);
`'add'`/`'edit'`/`'adding'`/`'editing'` modes receive a **form submission**
(`$_POST`-shaped, includes virtual/checkbox-only fields with no backing
column). A callback that checks `$values['some_checkbox']` (a form-only key)
while running in display/view mode will find it simply never set —
`isset(...)` is always false there, silently flipping whatever conditional
logic depended on it.

Found in `CRM_MeetingCommon::submit_meeting()`'s `'display'` case: it checked
`$values['timeless']` (the edit-form's checkbox name) to decide whether to
render a time/duration row, but a raw meeting record has no `timeless`
column — the real persisted signal is `duration == -1`, which every *other*
timeless check in that same file already used correctly. Fixed by matching
the existing pattern.

**How to apply**: when a `RecordBrowser`/`GenericBrowser` processing callback
checks a form-checkbox-shaped key directly, check what mode it's meant to run
in — if it can run against a raw record, look for the real persisted column
that key is actually derived from instead.

## `strtotime()` always reads slash dates as m/d/y, regardless of app locale

`Base_RegionalSettingsCommon::reg2time()` fed the regional-formatted date
string straight into PHP's `strtotime()`. For any user configured to
`%d/%m/%Y`, this is wrong: `strtotime()` interprets a slash-separated numeric
date as **month/day/year** no matter what `setlocale()` or app-level format
settings say (a documented PHP quirk, not something app config affects). Day
≤ 12 silently transposed day/month; day > 12 failed outright and callers'
`date('Y-m-d', false)`-style conversions coerced the `false` result to epoch
`1970-01-01`.

This is the single shared parser behind essentially every date-type field in
the app (birth date, meeting/fax dates, any RecordBrowser 'date'/'timestamp'
field) — a regression here is not scoped to one screen. Fixed by detecting a
`%d/%m/%Y`-shaped format and swapping the day/month capture groups before
handing off to `strtotime()`.

**How to apply**: any future date-format addition to
`$date_formats_proto` that puts day before month in a slash-separated pattern
needs the same swap-before-`strtotime()` treatment, or it will reproduce this
exact bug for that new format.

## "Restore Defaults" bypassing the admin-configured-default override chain

`Base_User_Settings`'s form builder used
`Base_User_SettingsCommon::get_admin($module, $name)` (which correctly falls
back through admin-configured → hardcoded literal) for a setting's
*displayed* value, but the *reset* value baked into the "Restore Defaults"
button's JS still came from each field's hardcoded literal directly — so a
regular user's Restore Defaults silently ignored whatever an administrator
had configured via **My settings/Administration → Default user settings**.

**How to apply**: any UI that offers "reset to default" needs to resolve
"default" through the same admin-override chain the rest of the settings
system uses (`get_admin()`), not re-derive it from the field's own
declaration — the two can silently diverge exactly like this.

## A settings/data report that looks like a browser bug usually isn't

An ActionBar showing far more icons than expected, reported as "looks fine in
Firefox, Chrome shows everything," turned out to be **Quick Access settings
data** (`Base_Menu_QuickAccessCommon::user_settings()`, 100% DB-backed per
`user_login_id`, nothing in that render path is browser-conditional) — not a
CSS/rendering difference. Two per-module toggles exist there: "Dashboard"
(confusingly named — actually means "show inline in the ActionBar") and
"Launchpad" (show in the Launchpad popup), both defaulting to on.

**How to apply**: before touching ActionBar/Leightbox/Launchpad CSS or JS for
a "shows too many/wrong icons" report, check that account's
**My settings → Control panel → Quick Access** first — a "different browser
looks different" report for this specific screen is almost always two
different accounts, or the same account's settings changed between
observations (e.g. an accidental Restore Defaults click), not a rendering bug.

## `setDefaults()` must run before `addElement()` for a QuickForm `static` element

Found 2026-08-03 while exercising RecordBrowser's `'file'` field type for the first
time in `modules/Custom/Tutorial/` (see `Dev-Tutorial.md` §11.2) — not specific to that
module; the same bug is latent anywhere the `'file'` type is used, including
`Utils_Attachment`'s own real production usage.

`Utils_FileUpload_Dropzone::add_to_form()` (`modules/Utils/FileUpload/Dropzone.php`)
originally did:
```php
$form->addElement('static', $identifier, $label, $content)->freeze();
$form->setDefaults(array($identifier => $content));
```
`HTML_QuickForm::addElement()` synchronously fires an `updateValue` event on the new
element, which reads whatever default the form *already* has for that field name —
at that point still the record's raw `'file'`-column value (an empty array on a
brand-new record, since no files are attached yet), set earlier in RecordBrowser's
generic per-field default pass. `HTML_QuickForm_static::setValue()` then does
`(string) $text` on that array, emitting `E_WARNING: Array to string conversion` —
which, since `REPORT_ALL_ERRORS` is on for this instance, blanks the whole module's
rendered output (see `CLAUDE.md`'s Error handling section) rather than just logging.
`setDefaults()` a line later, meant to supply the correct HTML string, comes too late —
the bad value was already consumed.

**Fix**: swap the two calls — `setDefaults()` first, so the correct string default is
already in place by the time `addElement()`'s synchronous `updateValue` fires:
```php
$form->setDefaults(array($identifier => $content));
$form->addElement('static', $identifier, $label, $content)->freeze();
```

**How to apply**: this is a general QuickForm trap, not specific to Dropzone — for any
custom element wrapper that both adds a `static` (or other auto-value-pulling) element
*and* wants to control its own default, set the default before adding the element, not
after. If a `'file'`-type field ever produces a blank RecordBrowser screen on "Add new
record" again, suspect this exact class of bug before assuming it's something new.

## Dead Smarty template variable with no `isset()` guard: `$new` in Contact.tpl

Found 2026-08-03, same session as the Dropzone bug above, via the same error-log
monitor — triggered by adding a new Contact in the browser under `adminltedark`.
`modules/CRM/Contacts/Photo/theme_adminlte/Contact.tpl` and its `theme_adminltedark`
copy both had:
```smarty
{foreach item=n from=$new}
    {$n}
{/foreach}
```
with no `{if isset($new)}` guard — unlike every other conditional var in the same
tooltip block right above it (`$subscription_tooltip`, `$fav_tooltip`, `$info_tooltip`,
`$clipboard_tooltip`, `$history_tooltip`, all correctly `{if isset(...)}`-wrapped).
Confirmed via grep (core + the one installed Premium module, `Premium/Projects`) that
**nothing anywhere assigns a `new` template variable** — this is dead/vestigial
markup, not a live feature with a producer that's merely sometimes absent. This is a
concrete instance of the general trap `CLAUDE.md`'s Error Handling section already
warns about: an unset key referenced in a compiled Smarty template throws
`E_WARNING: Undefined array key`, which — since `REPORT_ALL_ERRORS` is on for this
instance — blanks the whole module's rendered output (here: the entire "Add new
Contact" screen), not just a cosmetic gap.

**Fix**: wrapped both copies in `{if isset($new)}...{/if}`, matching the sibling blocks'
existing style exactly.

**How to apply**: when auditing a custom RecordBrowser `.tpl` (or any Smarty template)
for this class of bug, a variable referenced without `isset()`/`{if isset(...)}` next to
several siblings that *do* have the guard is a strong tell — check whether anything
in the codebase (core **and** Premium, since Premium is gitignored and invisible to the
Grep tool) actually ever assigns it before assuming the guard is unnecessary.

## `.form_error`'s `position: absolute` had no `top`, so it escaped its field row

Found 2026-08-03, same session as the two bugs above, while exercising required-field
validation in `modules/Custom/Tutorial/` under `adminltedark` — but not specific to
that module or theme; the rule is byte-identical (and equally missing `top`) in both
`modules/Utils/RecordBrowser/theme_adminlte/View_entry.css` and its `adminltedark`
copy, so any required RecordBrowser field under either theme was affected.

The error badge itself is generated in core, not a theme file:
`include/TCMSArray.php`'s array-form renderer emits
`<span class="form_error" id="...">...</span>` right after each field's control
(`error` key in the array `EpesiSmartyRenderer`/`TCMSArray` builds per element).
`View_entry.css` styles it:
```css
.Utils_RecordBrowser__View_entry .form_error:not(:empty) {
	position: absolute;
	right: 0px;
	height: 15px;
	...
	/* no top/bottom set at all */
}
```
`position: absolute` with no `top` falls back to the browser's "static position"
algorithm — workable enough under the original `<table>`-cell layout, but unreliable
once the row became a flex container (`.epesi-rv-row { display: flex }`, part of the
adminlte(dark) nested-table→flexbox rewrite — see `adminlte-theme.md`). Symptom:
the red "Field required" badge rendered detached from its own field, overlapping
unrelated content (observed: hanging up near the tab strip above).

**Fix, part 1**: pin it explicitly — added `top: 0;` (anchors to the top-right corner
of `.data`, which already has `position: relative`) to both theme copies of the rule.

**Fix, part 2** (found immediately after, same badge): `max-width: 50%` sized the
badge relative to `.data`'s own width - fine for a genuinely variable-length message,
but "Field required" (`__('Field required')`, `modules/Libs/QuickForm/QuickForm_0.php`)
is always short and fixed-length. On a wide field, 50% of the container is still wide,
and since the badge is anchored by `right: 0` with no `left`, it grows **leftward**
from the right edge to fill that width - overhanging neighboring content instead of
sitting as a compact tag. Changed to a fixed `max-width: 200px` in both theme copies,
which keeps it compact regardless of the row's actual width.

**Fix, part 3** (found immediately after that, same badge again - reported as "not
rendered full height"): the rule also had a hardcoded `height: 15px`, sized for the
original `<table>` layout's shorter rows. Under the flex rewrite, `.data` rows are
taller (fields fill the row via `height: 100%`), so the 15px badge only covered a
sliver at the top of the row instead of the row's real height. Fixed by replacing
`height: 15px` with `top: 0; bottom: 0` (stretches the badge to fill `.data`'s full
height, since it's already `position: absolute` inside `.data`'s `position: relative`)
and switching `display: block` + fixed vertical padding to `display: flex; align-items:
center` (so the text stays vertically centered at whatever height the row ends up
being, instead of being pinned near the top with a small fixed padding).

**How to apply**: any `position: absolute` rule in this theme pair that doesn't set
`top`/`bottom` is suspect — the flex rewrite changed what "static position" resolves
to versus the original table layout it replaced, in both width AND height. A hardcoded
pixel `height` (or a percentage `max-width` paired with `right:0`-anchoring) on an
element inside a row whose height/width is no longer fixed table-cell geometry is the
recurring shape of this whole bug: prefer stretching via `top/bottom`/`left/right` plus
flex-centering over hardcoded dimensions, for anything inside these flex rows.

## Known, still-open issue: Shoutbox delete UI doesn't work

The History tab's delete icon (`Apps_Shoutbox::delete_msg()`/
`can_delete_msg()`) does not actually delete a message on this install — not
yet root-caused (could be `can_delete_msg()`'s permission logic, or something
broken in GenericBrowser row-action rendering here). Workaround: soft-delete
directly —

```sql
UPDATE apps_shoutbox_messages SET deleted=1 WHERE id=<id>;
```

Never hard-delete; the module's own design keeps all messages in history.
